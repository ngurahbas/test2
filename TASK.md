# Opinion
Unfortunately I forgot this line "Implement other framework or technologies are welcome". 
If I have the total liberty to develop fullstack application, I shall use Spring Boot Kotlin, Spring DATA JDBC (not JPA), Mustache template engine and HTMX.
The line of codes should be cut in half. Fullstack application should use fullstack optimized technologies.
